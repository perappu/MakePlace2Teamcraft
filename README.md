# MakePlace2Teamcraft

Desktop application that takes MakePlace JSON file and turns it into an import link for Teamcraft. Includes any furniture dyes! (though it does not currently include walls used on partitions, working on that)

- Only work for saves from the latest version of MakePlace (currently 102).
- Attempts to open the MakePlace itch.io save file location first, then just defaults to My Documents if it can't find it.
